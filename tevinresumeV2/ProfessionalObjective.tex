    My main professional goals/interest is to utilize my professionalism, quantitative skillset, data-driven methodology, and leadership communication towards exploring a purposeful career/departmental trajectory in local government or a municipal executive leadership. By using both strategic and mentorship leadership by being assigned/hired to a  municipal department work by leveraging strategic planning, data, lean techniques and community and stakeholder relations and relationships. I would like to further explore my leadership \& managerial styles \& personality towards community and local government-based results through effective forms of communications towards developing \& mentoring my emerging professionals and leader. Finally, as an incoming Master's Student studying Public Administrations within the Public Service of Local Government and Municipal Strategic Analysis I am a proven leader that enjoys to be given challenges that continue to empower towards achieving best practices through outcome-based strategies development and execution. While learning from senior administrators and mentors I am open to leading projects, initiatives  towards succeeding in the profession as a Local Government Manager and Director.
